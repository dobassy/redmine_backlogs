REDMINE BACKLOGS
----------------

A Redmine plugin for agile teams. For more information,
please visit https://backlogs.github.io/www/


DIFFERENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY
---------------------------------------

The original repository did not work with Redmine 3.x. However, the feature branch had redmine 3.x compatible features. So I merged it.

Feature branch: [backlogs/redmine_backlogs at feature/redmine3](https://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs/tree/feature/redmine3)

(As of May 22, 2017)
